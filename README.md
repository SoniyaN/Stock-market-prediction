# Stock-market-prediction
<h3>Introduction:</h3>

<p>Prediction of stock market is a long-time attractive topic to researchers from different fields. In particular, numerous studies have been conducted to predict the movement of stock market using machine learning algorithms. Using the previous stock data of a company the future value can be predicted with the proper use of Machine Learning techniques such as (Long short term memory) LSTM and ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average). The graphs for the fluctuation of prices w.r.t the dates are plotted. </p>

<h3>Datasets used:</h3>

<p>In this project dataset is obtained from Yahoo Finance and analyzes previous stock data of companies, with help of certain features that affect stock value. This dataset comprises of following five variables:  open, close, low, high and volume. Open, close, low and high are different bid prices for the stock at separate times with nearly direct names. The volume is the number of shares that passed from one owner to another during the time period.</p>
